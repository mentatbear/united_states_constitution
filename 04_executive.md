# Executive

The Executive Branch ensures that the will of the Legislative branch is executed and protects the rights and lives of Citizens. The Military reports to the Executive branch as the final guard of freedom.

## Chief Executive

The Executive Branch is lead by a Chief Executive. The Chief Executive serves a 5 year term and can serve for 2 terms.

The Chief Executive is elected by the majority of the States. Each State has votes based on the number of Senators and Representative for the State. If a majority is not met, the Legislature appoints the Chief Executive by a simple majority vote.

The Chief Executive appoints a Commander who serves as commander-in-chief for the Military. The Commander reports to the Chief Executive but maintains ultimate control over the Military for the remainder of the Chief Executive's term. A new Commander can be chosen at the beginning of a term.

The Chief Executive appoints the other Chiefs for the Executive Board. They are then ratified by a simple majority in the Senate. A 2/3 majority of the Executive Board can override a decision by the Chief Executive or replace a Commander.

The Chief Executive has a line item veto for legislation. This veto can be overridden by 2/3 majority of the Senate.

The Chief Executive can pardon any Citizen for any reason of their choosing as a final chance for Justice or Mercy (as required).

The Chief Executive can declare a Person a major threat to the safety of others. If the Chief of Intelligence and the Military agree it is a major threat, the President can order the legal killing or termination of that Person. This must be a matter of public record but does not need to be released to the public for 7 years.

Each Chief appoints a Deputy who serves in their place if they are incapacitated. The President can appoint a replacement if needed who also need to be ratified by a simple majority in the Senate.
