# Military

The goal of the military is to establish and maintain peace and the freedom of all Persons. They defend the rights of the People.

The Military is led by a Commander who is the commander-in-chief. The Commander is appointed by the Chief Executive but can be removed by a 2/3 majority vote of the Executive Council after 30 days.
The Commander appoints a second in command.

The Commander holds supreme authority over the military. The Commander reports to the Chief Executive.

The Military can be deployed by the Commander for up to 1 year in order to respond to a crisis. After 1 year, the Chief Executive, Senate President and Chief Supreme Justice must approve the deployment.

Each State has a State Guard led by a State Commander. States can collectively form National Guards to pool resources.

The United States Military consists of the combined militaries of the Nations and States.

The branches are:

- Community Corps
- Marine Corps
- World Navy
- World Army
- World Air Force
- Peace Corps
- Space Force (shared by all Worlds)

The Commander has final say on the use and disposal of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The decision to use such destructive weapons should not be political rather about survival.
